# Curie AI

Curie AI is a fully frontend rendering machine learning tool that aim at helping business analysts or product managers build prototypes for data oriented projects. With Curie AI, they can iterate and refine what should data should be included in further development. Download a template, prepare the data, upload the file, train the model, and get the result. It's a simple workflow. Not much deep concepts on data science are required.

## Why?

Many companies invest a huge amount of money and manpower to build a AI before they justify what kinds of data are valuable to the projects. It's a common situation that we called 'Garbage in Garbage out'(GIGO). Usually, the bottleneck of a data oriented project is not about the model. It's about the domain knowledge and data quality. Therefore, Curie AI is built for examining whether the data input is useful. It may take months to build or refine a model to boost some accuracy, but it only takes few hours, to examine what if some columns are added or some columns are removed.
